#reagent-webcam

Inspired by this awesome tutorial (except using lein npm instead of npm directly): http://blob.tomerweller.com/reagent-import-react-components-from-npm

Example of importing this cool React Webcam into Reagent: https://github.com/mozmorris/react-webcam



# Installation
`lein deps`

`lein npm install`

`lein npm build run`

`lein clean && lein figwheel`


There are some attributes to mess with next to the component in src/reagent-webcam/core.cljs
There are more listed here (not sure how to add all of them): https://github.com/mozmorris/react-webcam
Go hog-wild!
